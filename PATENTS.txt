"Go-Term" Authors hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section)
patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import,
transfer and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of this
implementation of "Go-Term", where such license applies only to those patent
claims, both currently owned or controlled by "Go-Term" Authors and acquired in
the future, licensable by "Go-Term" Authors that are necessarily infringed by this
implementation of "Go-Term".  This grant does not include claims that would be
infringed only as a consequence of further modification of this

entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
that this implementation of "Go-Term" or any code incorporated within this

infringement, or inducement of patent infringement, then any patent
rights granted to you under this License for this implementation of "Go-Term"
shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
